# 50bird

## Overview

This is part of CS50 - Game Development with Lua and Love2D.

My implementation of the Project 1 challenges are in the Bird13 directory.

## Development

It is recommended to run a dev container in VS Code. This repository has an already configured container with LÖVE2D and OpenGL in WSL2. Alternatively, it is possible to install LÖVE2D on your computer and go on from there.
